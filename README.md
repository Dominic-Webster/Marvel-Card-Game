### How To Play

 When you first start the game, you will have an empty roster. However, you start with enough coins to unlock your first character!

- Head to the store and buy a common pack. Congratulations! Your roster is no longer empty!

 Now let's test your character out in battle!

- Head to the battle page, and select a fight (note: not all fights will be available. Choose a fight your character has access to).
- Every battle challenges one of three stats: Strength, Skill, or Speed. In future battles, select your character wisely.

 After a few battles, you should have enough coins to unlock more characters! Continue to fight and level up, and soon you'll be able to take on any challenge that comes yoour way!
